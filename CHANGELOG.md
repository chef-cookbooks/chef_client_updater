### Breaking Changes

- The default post install action for the resource has been switched from exec to kill. We believe that kill is the most likely default that users would expect as this allows a chef-client daemon running under a modern init system to cleanly upgrade. We highly recommend you check the readme and understand the exec and kill functions to determine which makes the most sense for how you run chef-client and how you execute the upgrade.
- The prevent downgrade attribute for the default recipe has been changes from true to false as this is the default for the resource.

### Other Changes

- If chef-client is forked and the user specifies an 'exec' post install action we will now warn and then kill as exec will not worked in a forked run
- Updated the windows task example in the readme to properly set the start time
- Updated the minimum version of mixlib-install to download 3.3.1 which includes many fixes for windows clientsA
- The resource now works around situations where mixlib-install may return an Array of versions

## 2.0.3 (2017-06-27)

- Fix #31 detect centos platform correctly

## 2.0.2 (2017-06-22)

- Fix air-gapped installation regression introduced by support for partial versions

## 2.0.1 (2017-06-16)

- Add information on upgrading Windows nodes and upgrading from Chef 11 to the readme

## 2.0.0 (2017-06-15)

- The custom resource has been converted to a LWRP so that we can support Chef Client updates from chef-client 11.6.2 to current. This also removes the need for the compat_resource cookbook.
- Support for upgrading Windows clients has been added
- A potential infinite loop in the upgrade process has been fixed
- The existing /opt/chef directory will now be cleaned up before the reinstall so leftover files will not carry over during upgrades
- Full Travis testing of the cookbook has been added

## 1.1.1 (2017-05-11)

- Fix the initial load of mixlib-install failing

## 1.1.0 (2017-05-10)

- Add support for download URL overrides via new properties on the resource and attributes for the default recipe. This requires mixlib-install 3.2.1, which we now ensure we install in the updater resource.
- Update the default post_install action in the recipe to match the resource (exec).
- Remove usage of class_eval in the resource since we use compat_resource and class_eval causes issues with some later Chef 12 releases.
- Fix the solaris platform name in the metadata.rb.
- Remove disabling FC016 and FC023 Foodcritic rules as these no longer alert.
- Avoid infinite loops if trying to install the latest chef-client version from any channel.
- Add a true test recipe and remove unused inspec tests
- Add debug logging of the current vs. desired versions to help troubleshooting
- Added a blurb in the readme outlining init system issues surrounding kill and the chef-client starting back up

## 1.0.2 (2017-04-07)

- Fix Chef 13 compatibility by using Kernel.exec not exec

# chef_client_updater

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/chef_client_updater.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/chef_client_updater) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/chef_client_updater.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef_client_updater)

This cookbook updates the chef-client

## Requirements

### Platforms

- All platforms with a chef-client package on downloads.chef.io

### Chef

- Chef 12.1+

### Cookbooks

- compat_resource

## Usage

This cookbook provides both a custom resource and a default recipe. The default recipe simply uses the custom resource with a set of attributes. You can add chef_client_updater::default to your run list or use the custom resource in a wrapper cookbook.

### Init System Caveats

When Chef runs as a service under a system init daemon such as Sys-V or systemd each chef run forks off from the main chef-client process being managed by the init system. For a chef-client upgrade to occur the running chef-client as well as the parent process must be killed, and a new chef-client must start using the updated binaries. This cookbook handles killing the chef-client, but your init system must properly handle starting the service back up. For systemd and upstart this can be handled via configuration, and chef-client cookbook 8.1.1 or later handles this by default. This functionality is not available in sys-v (RHEL 6, Debian 7, and others), so you will need to employ a secondary process such as a monitoring system to start the chef-client service.

## Resources
